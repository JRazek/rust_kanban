## Kanban App for the terminal written in rust
  This kanban app will allow the user to be more productive by prioritizing tasks and achieving goals faster
## Why?
  I am new to rust and wanted to learn the language in a project-oriented manner, feel free to drop feedback on my codeüòÅ. Another reason for building a TUI is that I spend the majority of my time in the terminal whether it is testing or running code or writing code in neovim. I haven't been able to find any other alternatives so I have started to make my own!
## Contribution
  Feel free to make a pull request or make a new issue, I am open to suggestions ‚úåÔ∏è
  I currently do not own a Mac so I am unable to test the app on Mac, if you can test it on Mac, please let me know if there are any issues.

## Known Issues

## PSA
<li>To migrate to v0.7 and above, you will have to export your saves to json from the command palette and then import them again, this is because the save format has changed and the old saves will not work with the new version.
<li>Cloud saves are not encrypted for this current version i am working on implementing end to end encryption for cloud saves, if you are concerned about your data being leaked, please do not use the cloud save feature for now.
